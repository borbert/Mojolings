# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE 04: Structs and Initialization - Object-Oriented Programming
# ==============================================================================
#
# BACKGROUND:
# Mojo structs are similar to Python classes but with important differences:
# - Compile-time optimization through static typing
# - Memory layout control for performance
# - Value semantics by default (copyable, movable)
# - Integration with systems programming patterns
#
# KEY CONCEPTS:
# - @value decorator: Automatically generates copy/move constructors
# - __init__ method: Constructor for initialization
# - Field access: Direct access to struct members
# - Memory efficiency: Structs are optimized for performance
#
# LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
# - Learn struct definition and initialization
# - Understand the @value decorator
# - Practice constructor implementation
# - See object creation and member access
#
# TASK: Complete the Point struct constructor


#  something goes here, i.e. similair to a decorator in python
struct Point(Copyable, Movable):
    """A 2D point with x and y coordinates."""

    var y: Int

    fn __init__(inoutself, x: Int, y: Int):
        # TODO: Initialize the x and y fields
        # HINT: Use self.x = x syntax
        self.x = ____  # <-- Replace with x
        self.y = ____  # <-- Replace with y
