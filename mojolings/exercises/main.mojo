Mojo-lings: Complete Tutorial Entry Point
=========================================

This is the main entry point for the Mojo-lings tutorial system.
It provides access to all exercises and guides you through learning Mojo.

USAGE:
    mojo main.mojo              # Show tutorial menu
    mojo main.mojo modern       # Run modern exercises guide  
    mojo main.mojo legacy       # Run legacy exercises guide
    mojo main.mojo help         # Show detailed help

RECOMMENDATION:
    Start with the modern exercises (001-010) as they use current Mojo 25.4 syntax
    and are designed to work reliably.

LEARNING PATH:
    Foundation (001-006): Core language concepts
    Intermediate (007-010): Collections, errors, interop, basic performance
    Advanced (011-022): SIMD, parallelization, GPU, cryptography, ML
