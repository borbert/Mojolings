# EXERCISE 06: Ownership and Borrowing - Memory Safety
#==============================================================================
#
# BACKGROUND:
# Mojo's ownership system prevents memory bugs (use-after-free, double-free,
# memory leaks) at compile time. This is similar to Rust but with Python-like
# syntax. It's one of Mojo's most important safety features.
#
# KEY CONCEPTS:
# - mut: Mutable reference (borrow for modification) - latest versions
# - read: Immutable reference (borrow for reading)
# - owned: Transfer ownership (move semantics)
# - Memory safety: Compiler prevents common bugs
# - Zero-cost: Safety with no runtime overhead
#
# LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
# - Understand reference types and borrowing
# - Learn when to use inout vs borrowed
# - Practice safe mutation of data structures
# - See how ownership prevents bugs
#
# TASK: Fix the function signature to allow safe mutation
