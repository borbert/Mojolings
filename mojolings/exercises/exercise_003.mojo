# EXERCISE 03: Functions - def vs fn
#==============================================================================
#
# BACKGROUND:
# Mojo has two function declaration styles:
# - def: Python-compatible, dynamic typing, flexible but slower
# - fn: Static typing required, optimized compilation, faster execution
#
# This dual approach lets you prototype quickly with 'def' and optimize
# with 'fn' when performance matters.
#
# KEY CONCEPTS:
# - def functions: Python-compatible, dynamic arguments and return types
# - fn functions: Require explicit types, compile to optimized code
# - Performance trade-offs: flexibility vs speed
# - When to use each style
#
# LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
# - Understand the difference between def and fn
# - Learn function type annotation syntax
# - See performance implications of each style
#
# TASK: Complete both function implementations
