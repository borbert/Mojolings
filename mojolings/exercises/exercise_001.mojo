# EXERCISE 01: Hello, Mojo! - Your First Mojo Program
# ==============================================================================
#
# BACKGROUND:
# Every programming language journey starts with "Hello, World!" Mojo uses
# Python-compatible syntax for basic operations, making it easy for Python
# developers to get started. However, under the hood, Mojo compiles to
# highly optimized machine code.
#
# LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
# - Understand Mojo's Python compatibility
# - Learn basic print statement syntax
# - See how simple Mojo programs work
#
# TASK: Fix the broken print statement to display "Hello, Mojo!"
