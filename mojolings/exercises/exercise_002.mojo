# EXERCISE 02: Variables and Types - Static vs Dynamic Typing
#==============================================================================
#
# BACKGROUND:
# Mojo supports both Python-style dynamic typing (var/def) and systems
# programming static typing (let/fn). This dual nature allows you to start
# with familiar Python syntax and optimize for performance when needed.
#
# KEY CONCEPTS:
# - var: mutable variable (can be reassigned)
# - let: immutable variable (cannot be reassigned)
# - Type inference: Mojo can often figure out types automatically
# - Performance: Static typing enables major optimizations
#
# LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
# - Understand variable declaration in Mojo
# - Learn the difference between var and let
# - See how Mojo infers types
#
# TASK: Declare an integer variable and print it

    Exercise 2: Variable declaration and type systems.
    
    Mojo's hybrid type system is one of its key innovations. You can write
    Python-style dynamic code for rapid prototyping, then add static types
    for performance when needed.
